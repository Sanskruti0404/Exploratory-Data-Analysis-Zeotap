# Exploratory Data Analysis, Lookalike Model, and Customer Segmentation

## Introduction

Hello! ðŸ˜Š Thank you for taking the time to review my work on this data analysis and machine learning assignment. This project showcases my skills in analyzing datasets, generating actionable insights, building a lookalike recommendation system, and segmenting customers using clustering techniques. The journey was both challenging and rewarding, and Iâ€™ve thoroughly enjoyed applying my technical knowledge to solve real-world business problems.

This README provides an overview of the logic, methodology, and results for each task in the project.

## Dataset Overview

The project consists of three datasets:
1. **Customers.csv**: Contains customer details such as `CustomerID`, `Region`, and demographic attributes.
2. **Products.csv**: Provides information on the products, including `ProductID`, `Category`, and `Price`.
3. **Transactions.csv**: Represents transactional data, including `CustomerID`, `ProductID`, `Quantity`, and `TotalValue`.

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Objective
The goal of EDA was to explore the datasets, identify trends, and generate actionable insights to guide business decisions.

### Methodology
1. **Data Overview**:
   - Checked the structure of each dataset (e.g., column names, data types, and missing values).
   - Analyzed summary statistics to understand data distribution.

2. **Visualizations**:
   - Created meaningful plots to uncover patterns:
     - **Customer Distribution by Region**: Highlighted which regions had the most customers.
     - **Average Product Price by Category**: Showed how product prices varied by category.
     - **Transaction Value Distribution**: Identified spending patterns among customers.

3. **Insights**:
   - Derived five key insights:
     1. The most frequent region of customers was identified, helping to target marketing efforts effectively.
     2. Premium categories with the highest average price were highlighted for maximizing profit margins.
     3. The average transaction value provided insights into customer spending behavior.
     4. The most purchased product was identified, guiding inventory optimization.
     5. Regions generating the highest transaction value were identified, helping allocate resources strategically.

### Results
EDA provided a clear understanding of customer behavior, product trends, and regional performance. These insights serve as the foundation for subsequent tasks.

## Task 2: Lookalike Model

### Objective
To identify similar customers based on purchasing patterns, enabling personalized recommendations and cross-selling opportunities.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Merged `Customers`, `Products`, and `Transactions` datasets into a consolidated view.
   - Created a **customer-product interaction matrix**, where rows represented customers and columns represented products, with cell values as quantities purchased.

2. **Data Standardization**:
   - Normalized the interaction matrix using `StandardScaler` to ensure features were on the same scale.

3. **Cosine Similarity**:
   - Calculated cosine similarity to measure the closeness between customers based on their purchasing patterns.

4. **Lookalike Generation**:
   - For the first 20 customers, identified the top 3 most similar customers along with similarity scores.

### Results
The lookalike results were saved in `Sanskruti_Lookalike.csv` with the following format:
```
CustomerID, Lookalike1_ID, Lookalike1_Score, Lookalike2_ID, Lookalike2_Score, Lookalike3_ID, Lookalike3_Score
```

This task demonstrated how businesses can use customer similarity to drive personalized marketing campaigns and improve customer engagement.

## Task 3: Customer Segmentation

### Objective
To group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior, allowing the business to tailor marketing strategies for each segment.

### Methodology
1. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Aggregated transaction data to calculate `TotalValue` and `Quantity` purchased by each customer.
   - Merged customer profiles (e.g., `Region`) to provide additional context for clustering.

2. **Normalization**:
   - Standardized the features to ensure equal contribution to the clustering algorithm.

3. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Tested different cluster numbers (from 2 to 10) and evaluated their quality using the **Davies-Bouldin Index**.
   - Selected the optimal number of clusters with the lowest Davies-Bouldin Index.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Created scatterplots to visualize customer segments.
   - Used heatmaps to display cluster centers, highlighting feature values for each cluster.

5. **Results Storage**:
   - Saved the clustering results in `Clustering_Results.csv` with the following structure:
     ```
     CustomerID, TotalValue, Quantity, Region, Cluster
     ```

### Results
Customer segmentation enabled the business to:
- Identify high-value customers for loyalty programs.
- Segment low-value customers for upselling opportunities.
- Allocate resources effectively across different customer groups.

## Challenges and Learnings

1. **Challenge**: Handling missing data and ensuring datasets were properly merged without information loss.
   - **Solution**: Applied data cleaning techniques and verified dataset integrity at each step.

2. **Challenge**: Selecting the right number of clusters for segmentation.
   - **Solution**: Used the Davies-Bouldin Index to objectively evaluate clustering quality.

3. **Learning**: This project deepened my understanding of how machine learning and data analysis can drive business decisions.
